## ‚≠êÔ∏è Why OpenSurvey?

OpenSurvey, the open-source alternative to Google Docs and Typeform empowers users to craft short-answer and multiple-choice questions effortlessly. Its simplicity and speed are unmatched. Plus, for those seeking privacy and control, it offers a self-hosting option. Choose OpenSurvey for elegant, transparent, efficient survey creation.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Self Host
